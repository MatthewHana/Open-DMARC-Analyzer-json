# Software Support Chart

Due to the limited time available to developrs to maintain support, dates must be set where support must end. The following is a chart outlining the support shedule for Open DMARC Analyzer.

# Support Cycle

- Pre-stable versions recieve one version cycle of full spport and one cycle of critical support before being considered end of life. Due to the lack of release cycle for these versions, support time can wildly vary.
- The final release candidate will have critical support until the end of a year that the stable version is released.
- All versions of a stable version are considered supported, though it is encouraged to keep updated to the latest stable release.
- Stable versions reach end of life at the end of a year that a new stable version is released. The exception is LTS versions - those will recieve 3 years of support after a new stable version is released.

# Support Levels

- **Full Support** means that software will recieve regular bug fixes, feature updates (if applicable), and security fixes. All current versions do not have an expected End of Support or End of Life date, as new version releases are not always predictable.

- **Critical Support** means that software will no longer recieve regular bug fixes or feature updates, but security fixes will still be provided.

- **End of Life** means that there is no more support what-so-ever. Issues, bug reports, and code contributions to these versions will be ignored or rejected.
